# VoiceSDK Toolkit - Unity
## What is VoiceSDK Toolkit (VSTK)?

The VoiceSDK Toolkit (VSTK) is an open-source project to share foundational assets, building blocks, and samples for common interactions for creating a custom voice experience in Unity. This toolkit is not a rulebook, but an introduction that is meant to guide and inspire devs to innovate unique implementations of voice interaction. For additional design principles and best practices, see [Design Best Practices](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/voice-sdk-improving-results).
